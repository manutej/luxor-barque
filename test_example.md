# Introduction

This is a **test document** for BARQUE with mathematical formulas and beautiful formatting.

## Mathematical Formulas

BARQUE supports beautiful mathematical formulas using LaTeX syntax.

### Inline Math

The famous equation $E = mc^2$ shows the relationship between energy and mass.

The Pythagorean theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

### Display Math

The Gaussian integral:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

Euler's identity (the most beautiful equation in mathematics):

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

The derivative definition:

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

## Code Examples

Here's some Python code:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence"""
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib = list(fibonacci(10))
print(fib)  # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
